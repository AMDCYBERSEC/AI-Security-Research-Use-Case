# AI-Security-Research-Use-Case
## Task: Analyze and Exploit Security Vulnerabilities in an AI Model
   You are required to demonstrate your skills in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in an AI/ML model. The task involves performing a penetration test on a pre-trained model, 
   crafting adversarial attacks, and proposing defensive strategies to secure the model. Your results will help shape AI Security Academy lab content focused on AI model exploitation and hardening

## Objective
   1. Analyze the vulnerabilities of a pre-trained AI/ML model.
   2. Simulate an adversarial attack to highlight potential exploitation methods.
   3. Propose and implement mitigation strategies to defend against the attacks.
   4. Document the process to serve as a hands-on lab exercise.

## Instructions
### Step 1: Model Vulnerability Analysis
1. Choose a pre-trained model (or train a simple model if needed):
   Options:
   
   a. An image classifier (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, or a custom CNN trained on CIFAR-10).
   
   b. An image classifier (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, or a custom CNN trained on CIFAR-10).
   
   c. A text classifier (e.g., BERT fine-tuned for sentiment analysis).
   
   d. A regression model (e.g., predicting house prices or another dataset of your choice).
    

Alternatively, use a publicly available model from Hugging Face, Kaggle, TensorFlow Hub, or PyTorch Hub.

3. Analyze potential attack vectors:
   
    a. Review the model architecture, training process, and assumptions.
   
    b. Identify areas vulnerable to adversarial attacks (e.g., input data, model parameters, gradients).

5. Document the findings:
   
   a. Highlight at least _**ONE** exploitable vulnerabilitie_ in the chosen model.
   
### Step 2: Simulate Adversarial Attacks - Chose One Of The Following Attack Scenario
1. Define the attack scenarios:
   
   a. **Evasion Attack**: Craft adversarial examples (e.g., small perturbations to inputs) that mislead the model into incorrect predictions.
   
    b. **Inference Attack**: Extract sensitive information or reverse-engineer aspects of the training dataset.
   
   c. **Model Extraction Attack**: Attempt to replicate the model by querying it and observing outputs.

4. Implement the attacks:

    a. For evasion attacks, use frameworks like Foolbox, ART, CleverHans, or create your own 
        perturbation code.
   
    b. For inference attacks, explore techniques such as membership inference or model inversion.
   
    c. For model extraction, demonstrate how the model's responses can be used to approximate its behavior.
   
6. Evaluate the impact:

   a. Show how the attacks degrade model performance or compromise confidentiality.
   
   b. Use metrics, confusion matrices, or visualizations to present results.


### Step 3: Mitigation Strategies

1. Propose possible defenses:
   
   a. Techniques such as adversarial training, gradient masking, input sanitization, or differential privacy.
  
3. Implement and demonstrate:
   
    a. Apply the chosen mitigation strategy to the model.
   
    b. Evaluate its effectiveness against the same attack scenarios.
   
    c. Highlight improvements and remaining gaps.

### Step 4: Lab Documentation

1. Prepare a Jupyter Notebook or detailed lab document with:
   
     a. Clear instructions for analyzing, attacking, and defending the model.
   
     b. Code snippets for each step.
   
     c. Visualizations to illustrate attacks and defenses (e.g., perturbed images, accuracy graphs).
   
     d. Explanations of each method and its security implications.

4. Include discussion points:
 
    a. How the attack works and why it is effective.
   
    b. The strengths and limitations of the proposed defenses.
   
    c. Suggestions for further research or exploration.

## Deliverables

1. A Jupyter Notebook (or equivalent) containing:
   
   a. Model analysis and identified vulnerabilities.
   
   b. Code and results for the adversarial attacks.
   
   c. Code and results for the mitigation strategies.
   
   d. Detailed explanations for each step.
   
3. A summary report (max 2 pages) covering:
   
   a. The vulnerabilities discovered and their implications.
   
   b. The attacks performed and their impact.
   
   c. The effectiveness of the proposed mitigations.
   
   d. Recommendations for securing similar models in real-world applications.
